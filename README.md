This code implements the ability to convert data from the ".xlsx" format to the ".xml" format in a specific structure.
The algorithm forms the structure of the final ".xml" file so that the "SXW" program (construction cost estimates) 
could read it. This makes it possible to automatically include resources (materials) in the preparation of estimates for
construction.
